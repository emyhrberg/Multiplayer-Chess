Steps for development:
- Get a chessboard on the screen
- Get a chess game playing
- Host a server to play the chess game on
- Set up client server communication,
so that all moves are sent to server and updated 
back at the client side.
This means one client can play a game and another
client can be connected to the server and the game will be played there
- Make it so the other browser is playing the black pieces~
